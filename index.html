    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Redenss Web Element Inspector Extension ("we", "our", or "extension") collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our browser extension.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>Our Redenss Web Element Inspector Extension is designed to help users inspect web elements, analyze spacing (horizontal, vertical, padding, margins), analyze pages, and search for elements to view their properties. The extension operates entirely within your browser and does not collect or transmit any personal information to external servers.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The Redenss Web Element Inspector Extension:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Does not collect personal information</li>
        <li>Does not track browsing history</li>
        <li>Does not store user data on external servers</li>
        <li>Does not use cookies or similar tracking technologies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Any data generated during the use of the extension (such as element properties, measurements, or standards) is stored locally in your browser and is not transmitted to us or any third parties.</p>

    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    <p>The extension may use browser local storage to save your preferences and settings to improve your experience. This data remains on your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>Our extension requires certain permissions to function properly, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access to the current tab's content to inspect elements</li>
        <li>Ability to inject content scripts to provide element inspection functionality</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used solely for the purpose of providing the extension's core functionality and not for collecting user data.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Redenss Web Element Inspector Extension does not integrate with or utilize any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the extension accordingly. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
